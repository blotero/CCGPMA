# A correlated chained Gaussian Processes for multiple annotators--(CCGPMA)

CCGPMA is based on the [chained GPs model--(CGP)](https://github.com/SheffieldML/ChainedGP), which is a Multi-GPs framework where the parameters of an arbitrary likelihood function are modeled with multiple independent GPs (one GP prior per parameter). Unlike CGP, we consider that multiple correlated GPs model the likelihood's parameters. For doing so, we take as a basis the ideas from a Multi-output GP--(MOGP) regression~\cite{alvarez2012kernels}, where each output is coded as a weighted sum of shared latent functions via a semi-parametric latent factor model--(SLFM). In contrast to the MOGP, we do not have multiple outputs but multiple functions chained to the given likelihood parameters. From the multiple annotators' point of view, the likelihood parameters are related to the labelers' behavior; thereby, CCGPMA models the labelers' behavior as a function of the input features while also taking into account annotators' interdependencies. Moreover, our proposal is based on the so-called inducing variables framework, in combination with stochastic variational inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a probabilistic approach to model the labelers' behavior as a function of the input features while also considering annotators' interdependencies
